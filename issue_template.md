>If this is a request for a new term, please provide us with the as much of the following information as possible.

>1. Preferred term label (e.g. gray platelet syndrome)

>2. Suggested parent term (Please look in the hierarchy of the DO using the [DO Browser] (http://disease-ontology.org/) or other browsers such as [OLS](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/doid) and find the place in the DO where the new term best fits)
The type of disease (e.g. metabolic disease, syndrome). It is helpful (if known) to identify where the term should be placed in the tree. If this proposed term is part of a group of diseases or a member of an OMIM phenotypic series, please let us know. 

>3. Citation/Provenance: Include the PubMed ID(s) and the context of the request (published animal model). 
Include a PubMed ID or URL(s) to refer to any relevant article(s) that provides information about the suggested term).

>4. Synonyms (e.g. platelet alpha-granule deficiency)


>5. Textual definition (the definition should be understandable even for non-specialists.  
DO defines disease types based on clinically significant symptoms, phenotypes, anatomical location or cell type of origin that distinguishes each disease term from it's parent and sibling terms. Where the symptoms/phenotypes listed are those that differentiate the specific disease from other subtypes of the parent class and the gene listed has causative mutations for the disease. Ideally, we would include the result of the mutation (decreased production of X), where known. 

DO definitions are written follow the pattern " A [disease parent term] that is characterized by symptom A and symptom B that has_material_basis_in mutation in gene Xyz on chromosome ##."

Examples: 
A hypophosphatasia that has_material_basis_in an autosomal recessive mutation of ALPL on chromosome 1p36.12.

A Griscelli syndrome characterized by silvery gray sheen of the hair, hypopigmentation of the skin and neurological impairment without immunodeficiency that has_material_basis_in mutations in the MYO5A gene on chromosome 15q21.2. 


>6. Any additional notes to clarify the meaning or use of the term. Please provide a PubMed ID or URL(s) for the source of this information.

>7. List any additional cross-references for the disease (OMIM:139090, ORDO:721, ICD10CM:D69.1, UMLS_CUI:C0272302, MESH:D055652)
      
>8. List any apprpriate tissue (antomical location, UBERON ontology) or cell type (CELL ontology) relationships 
   anatomy: located_in
   cell type: derived_from 
   
   Examples: 
An adrenal cancer that is located_in the cortex (steroid hormone-producing tissue) of the adrenal gland and that has_material_basis_in abnormally proliferating cells derives_from epithelial cells. 

A cell type cancer that has_material_basis_in abnormally proliferating cells derived_from precursor cells called blast cells. 

A carcinoma that derives_from epithelial cells, with polygonal accumulation of secondary lysosomes in the cytoplasm.
